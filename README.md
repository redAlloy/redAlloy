Hello, I'm @redAlloy. My sideprojects will go here. I just hope to learn anything from my mistakes. I'm fairly new to programming, lots of work ahead of me.

Though I don't commit to any one particular direction just yet, for the moment my areas of focus are: Android Development; Data Science & AI;

Now Learning Kotlin programming language and algorithmics.

Currently splitting my time between university, work and a lot of changes in personal life, but I'll try to be as consistant as possible here.
